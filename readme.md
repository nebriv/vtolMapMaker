# Usage

Idk - fill in the variables down at the bottom of the script and see if it works. I'll break this out and fill this in as it becomes more finished.

# Installation
1. Install GDAL stuff.
   1. The installation was a little wonky. You need to install GDAL for Windows. Unsure if it works for linux/mac. Follow the instructions here: https://pypi.org/project/GDAL/ and here: https://gisinternals.com/sdk/

2. pip install -r requirements.txt
   1. Pray it works.
3.   Download this and put it in this folder:
